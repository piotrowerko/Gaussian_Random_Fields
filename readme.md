These are simple scripts for 1D and 2D Gasussian Random field generators.
The generators are searching for a set of eigenvectors, covariance matrix.
The mathematical apparatus behind 
the generators is described on page 82 of the book:
"Relibility of Structures" - Andrzej S. Nowak. 2000.

Generators can be used, for example, 
to model uncertainties related to the construction 
of engineering structures, such as imperfections 
/ manufacturing errors or random material features.
